# Prediction of health insurance cost

This repository contains my statistical analysis and predictive modeling work on predicting individual medical insurance costs. The project utilizes a dataset with health-related factors such as BMI, age, smoking status, and family demographics to forecast insurance costs accurately.

#### Project Overview
The aim of this study is to apply statistical tools to analyze insurance cost data and develop a predictive model that estimates a person's insurance expenses based on various personal attributes. This involves detailed exploratory data analysis, regression modeling, and residual analysis to ensure accurate predictions and valuable insights.

#### Components
- **Data Cleaning:** Ensured a clean dataset with no missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilized histograms, box plots, and a correlation heatmap.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Performed multiple linear regression analysis to predict insurance costs.
- **Validation:** Included residual analysis and actual vs predicted comparisons to validate the model.

#### How It Works
1. **Data Preparation:** The dataset of 1,338 records is preprocessed to ensure quality and consistency.
2. **Analysis:** Conduct statistical analysis to understand the relationships between variables.
3. **Model Building:** Develop and refine multiple regression models to predict the costs based on independent variables.
4. **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using various statistical tests and visualizations of residuals and predictions.

#### Importance of the Study
Understanding and predicting medical insurance costs can help individuals and insurers manage health care expenditures more effectively. This analysis provides insights that could lead to better cost management and risk assessment in health insurance policies.

This repository includes all necessary data files, Python code for the analysis, and detailed documentation on the processes and findings. It's designed to be accessible for others interested in statistical analysis, predictive modeling, or health insurance cost studies.
